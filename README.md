## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Saved previous code as comment, for quick development purpose in future
- [x] Added comments to enhance readability

Note: No sounds plays through a gif file. Audio functionality works perfectly in live demo link below.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
None, no additional help needed from outside sources.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The challenge I encountered in creating this submission was that the default generated code was different from the one described in the tutorial, so navigating the new codebase, and the layout, was a slight challenge at first, however, I quickly overcame it within about 3 minutes as i understood the placements and specific usability of those code segments. Navigating the new layout was a bit tougher, but I overcame it by searching the keyboard shortcuts online (such as the live code preview mode and the 'export / push to GitHub's feature). The new glitch UI layout seems better but some of the features were not visible at first. Another challenge was to know and learn some of the new JavaScript features that I did not use before, such as the audio playback feature. It was interesting and i quickly learnt it via understanding and implementing. Apart from these challenges, other challenges might be simple bugs and errors that I quickly fixed within seconds, therefore no major challenges encountered (apart from the previously mentioned ones).

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
After completing my submission, I turned more curious about the expansion and applicability of web development, as it seems that web3 will be the next phase in web development, so to implement new APIs and faster code (to execute on decentralized systems), I might need to learn other languages such as Rust for crypto currency and web assembly. My question is that how useful are these new languages in the web development fields? And what languages and frameworks / stacks should I learn to be competent enough in this field? Moreover, would the current full-stack languages and frameworks, become outdated? And if so, are there other everlasting programming languages such that the current skills are transferrable?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If i had a few extra hours to work on this project, I would spend them in creating custom animations to each buttons, implementing funny but memorable audio to those buttons, and add a 'shuffle' mode, where it will shuffle up the button colors, and their audios, and animations - such that it feels like a new game, a new challenge! And a 'wild' mode button, that would change the button placement order and size of each button randomly: truly a dangerous challenge. The optional features were a good addition to the original, therefore doing something similar in that region would be cool too. Apart from feature additions, I would refactor the code style, such that the code is well documented and therefore reduce debugging time.
