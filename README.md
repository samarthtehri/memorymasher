## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn

* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Saved previous code as comment, for quick development purpose in future
- [x] Added comments to enhance readability

Note: No sounds plays through a gif file. Audio functionality works perfectly in live demo link below.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
None

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If i had a few extra hours to work on this project, I would spend them in creating custom animations to each buttons, implementing funny but memorable audio to those buttons, and add a 'shuffle' mode, where it will shuffle up the button colors, and their audios, and animations - such that it feels like a new game, a new challenge! And a 'wild' mode button, that would change the button placement order and size of each button randomly: truly a dangerous challenge. The optional features were a good addition to the original, therefore doing something similar in that region would be cool too. Apart from feature additions, I would refactor the code style, such that the code is well documented and therefore reduce debugging time.
